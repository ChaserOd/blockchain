    <br />
   <br />


   
   <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Copy below Google form link. Next, go to Crome/ Google browser, search and open the link at browser. At form fill details like coin name you want to launch, total supply of coin etc and submit. </p>
 <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto"> https://forms.gle/dtaSLDw4qWo2JuXQA</p>
  <br /> <br />
 <br /> <br />
  
   <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
<strong>Step 2:</strong> To successfully launch a new coin and grow the community, you need to begin with a mining and airdrop campaign where your members can mine or claim points for future airdrop allocations.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
 To help you get started, we have developed a dedicated Core Wallet and mining-enabled website that allows users to earn airdrop points through mining. Click the <strong>“Copy Claim Website Link”</strong> button below and share the link with your community, friends, and networks to onboard new users.
<br />
This platform enables you to run a complete airdrop campaign for your project. It includes a Core Wallet download section where users can install the wallet on their computers and begin mining points immediately.
<br />
As your community grows, the same platform can be used to distribute your newly launched coin or token, conduct ICOs, run crowdfunding campaigns, and allocate rewards to users. You can also create dedicated airdrop channels on X (Twitter) and Telegram to promote the campaign and share the claim link.
<br />
Any user who downloads the Core Wallet and starts mining will automatically begin earning airdrop points..

   <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
 <strong>Step 3:</strong> Also, click & copy the 'Web App Airdrop Link' from below button and share it on social media to grow your user base. The airdrop page allows users to claim reward points by participating in the campaign. All points collected by users will be converted into your project’s actual coin tokens and distributed to them during the official airdrop allocation period. You may also share these links on your own Telegram channel or integrate them into your dedicated airdrop website, if you have one.

<p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
 As thousand and millions of users start mining and claming points and as your project grows and gains popularity, we will launch your project on a parallel mainnet blockchain within the Pancono ecosystem for free under PAN-20 Token standard.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-200 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  Once your coin is successfully deployed and the mainnet goes live on Pancono’s blockchain, at that stage, you can decide how the coins will be distributed according to the tokenomics you define, start ICO to sell your token, raise funds, attract investors etc.
